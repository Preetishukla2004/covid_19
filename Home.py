st.markdown("COVID-19 created one of the biggest health challenges in recent history. Over time, the virus changed into different variants, and each variant showed different levels of infection, spread, and survival. Some variants spread very fast, while others lasted for a longer time in specific regions. To understand this better, researchers started collecting and analyzing survival data of these variants. Survival data analysis helps in studying how long a particular variant remained active in a population and what factors influenced its duration. This includes comparing case numbers, infection rates, and recovery patterns across regions. By analyzing this data, scientists can identify which variants were more dangerous, which ones ended quickly, and how mutations affected the overall pandemic. Such analysis is very useful for predicting future outbreaks, planning better control strategies, and preparing for new mutations. In short, COVID-19 variants survival data analysis gives us a clear picture of how different variants behaved and how they shaped the global pandemic.")
