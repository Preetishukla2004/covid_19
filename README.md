# 🧬 COVID-19 Variant Survival Data Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the **survival rates and trends of COVID-19 variants** using Python-based data science techniques.  
The goal is to uncover insights such as:
- How survival rates vary across different variants (Delta, Omicron, Alpha, etc.)
- The effect of age, gender, and vaccination on survival
- Predicting survival probability using machine learning models

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Collect and clean COVID-19 variant data  
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**  
- Visualize key survival trends  
- Build **ML models** to predict survival outcomes  
- Generate actionable insights for better understanding of variant impacts
